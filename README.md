# Sentiment Analysis for Indonesian Vice Presidential Debate 22 December 2023
This project will demonstrate the sentiment of each candidate during the live Vice Presidential Debate on Narasi TV youtube channel.

## Setup
install all the requirement libraries in the requirements_streamlit.txt using command :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We suggest the reader to use a dedicated virtual environment when working on this project to avoid any mismatching library version during install. So before installing all the requirements, make the virtual environment using these following commands :
```
## make the dedicated venv
python -m venv your_project_name

## to enter the venv
source your_project_name/bin/activate
```
